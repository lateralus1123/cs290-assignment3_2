Tasks: Mapped out on paper the overall logic of the website. How would the GIST info be collected? How would my script interpret it? How would I add the GIST info to the screen? What logic does the functionality of the add/remove buttons involve?

Tasks: All ideas on paper are implemented in code except for allowing the user to change the number of pages returned. By default it is currently set at one.

Tasks: Finished the functionality of the site by allowing user to choose between 1 and 5 page results. Issues overcome involved getting script to wait to make a call for subsequent page until current page was read and interpreted.
